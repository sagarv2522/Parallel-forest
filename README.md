* An ensemble of decision trees trained on bootstrapped data with randomly selected features. Ensemble learning refers to building multiple models and aggregating their predictions. Their primary benefits include reducing variance, bias, and the chance of overfitting.

* Here, you will train, tune, and evaluate a random forest model using data from spreadsheet of survey responses from 129,880 customers. It includes data points such as class, flight distance, and inflight entertainment. Random forest model will be used to predict whether a customer will be satisfied with their flight experience.
